==============

Discussing the purpose and goals of QUILTBAG++ Tech, as we create this exciting new thing. 

For now, all of the content should go on the **[Wiki](https://github.com/quiltbagtech/whatisquiltbag/wiki)** for this repo.

(... with the exception of any files that need to be uploaded -- those can go in the repo. I've added my screenshots about how to use the github wiki  ~robyn)
